# How to contribute

This repository is intended to be a way for first-time open source contributors
to get their feet wet. We want to keep it as easy as possible to contribute changes 
that get new contributors used to the process. There are a few guidelines that we
need contributors to follow.

## Getting Started

* Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free).
* Fork the repository on GitHub.

## Making Changes

* Create a feature branch for your contribution.
* To quickly create a feature branch based on master, run `git checkout -b
    add-[name]-[city-name]` where `[city-name]` is the name of your city and 
    `[name]` is your name. Please avoid working directly on the `master` branch.
* Make commits of logical units, only one change per commit.  Make sure entry has a blank line between it and the previous entry.
* Make sure your commit messages are in the proper format. Usually, this will just be 
`Adding [name] from [city-name]` where `[city-name]` is the name of your city and `[name]` is your name.

## Submitting Changes

* Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository.
